## 🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR TABLE CREATION

### Option 1: Manual Supabase Dashboard Creation
```sql
1. Login to Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run: d:\Users\Admin\Desktop\CRM\CRM BACKEND\database\schema.sql
4. Verify table creation
```

### Option 2: Environment Variables Setup
```bash
1. Add to Railway environment:
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
2. Redeploy backend
3. Tables will auto-create on startup
```

### Option 3: Direct API Execution
```bash
# Once credentials are available:
node database/setup.js
```
