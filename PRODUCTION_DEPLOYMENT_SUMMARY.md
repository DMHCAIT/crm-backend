### ⚠️ **One Small Issue: Railway Needs Manual Redeploy**

#### 🔍 **The Situation**
Railway is currently running an **older version** of your code that only has basic endpoints. The complete API implementation we built is in GitHub, but Railway hasn't auto-deployed it yet.

#### 🎯 **The Solution**
You need to **manually trigger a redeploy** in your Railway dashboard:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Find your project**: `crm-backend-production-5e32`
3. **Click "Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"**
4. **Select latest commit**: `bf47f76`
