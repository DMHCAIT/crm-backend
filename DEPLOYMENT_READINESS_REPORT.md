- ‚úÖ **Local Backend**: 100% complete with all missing endpoints implemented  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Railway Backend**: Outdated - needs deployment of new endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Supabase fully configured and working
- ‚úÖ **Environment**: All configurations ready

   ‚Ä¢ /api/leads (404 - not deployed)
   ‚Ä¢ /api/dashboard/stats (404 - not deployed)
   ‚Ä¢ /api/students (404 - not deployed)
   ‚Ä¢ All other new endpoints (404 - not deployed)
```

### **2. Package Dependencies**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Railway needs multer package for file uploads
‚ö†Ô∏è Need to ensure all new dependencies are installed
```

### **3. Environment Variables**
```
‚úÖ Facebook token updated (new token applied)
‚ö†Ô∏è Railway environment may need manual updates
‚ö†Ô∏è Integration API keys still using demo values
```
